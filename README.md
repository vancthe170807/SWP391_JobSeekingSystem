## II. Information of Topic Project

### 1. Problem
Job seekers work hard to gain the right skills and knowledge to give them an edge over others in the role they seek. However, at times, despite their best efforts, one may find it difficult to move a step closer to this sought-after job. Hence a platform for listing out the availability of jobs irrespective of the field is required. Furthermore, a job site serves a dual purpose. On one hand, it lists out the availability of jobs to candidates, and on the other, it serves as a database of registered candidate’s profiles for companies to shortlist. The objective is to develop a software solution to predict the availability of jobs based on location, sectors, package, platform, interest and eligibility. As it is important to keep the candidates engaged during their job search, it is important to provide facets on the above - mentioned criteria so that they can narrow down to the jobs of their choice.
